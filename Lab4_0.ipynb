The semi-major axis then describes the radius of the equator and the semi-minor axis defines the distance from the equatorial plane to the poles.

    "### Using CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically it was much more difficult to establish height above the ellipsoid (vertical position by **elevation**) than to establish the position along its surface (horizontal position by **geodetic latitude and longitude**). Thus often vessels were positioned by latitude and longitude using a positioning system. The vertical location was then estimated by combining water level observations at a tide gauge with an estimation of the draft of the vessel using some model for transferring the observed water level to your location.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem that occurs is that the sea state at the gauge and the vessel are different. This is addressed by filtering out the wave action at the gauge and observing  the vertical motions of the vessel due to sea state (**heave**). These heave measurements then need to be applied to the sensor observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem that occurs is that the entire vessel will move up and down in the water as a function of the speed with which it moves through the water, a phenomenon known as **settlement**. Also its bow will either pitch up or down, a phenomenon known as **squat**. To correct the sensor observations it is then necessary to create a model of the settlement and squat as a function of speed through the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly position the sonar transducers it was thus necessary to\n",
    "1. Observe water levels at a tide gauge and transfer the observations to your location using some model\n",
    "2. Observe speed through water using a **log** (device that measures speed though water) and estimate the resultant vertical motion through some settlement and squat model\n",
    "3. Observe the heave and apply it to the observed data\n",
    "4. Correct the observed data for the vertical motion induced through roll, pitch and yaw\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using ERS\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of positioning using **Global Navigation Satellite Sytems (GNSS)** such as GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Beidou (China), Galileo (Eurpoean Union), IRNSS (India) and QZSS (Japan) it has become possible to directly estimate height above the ellipsoid with sufficient accuracy. This has obviated the need for observing many of the parameters other than the motion of the vessel, thereby greatly simplifying and enhancing the quality of positioning at sea. However, we still do need to correct for the motion of the vessel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the depth data are to be referenced to a chart datum a model needs to be available to map the ellipsoid referenced data to chart datum. If such a model is not available, water level data needs to be collected to enable the creation of one. However, this does not have to occur at the same time as depth data collection (unlike CRS surveys)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using GRS\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we will reference the data to the EGM2008 **geoid** associated to WGS84. Much like a reference ellipsoid a geoid is a model of the Earth, however, a far more complex one. A geoid is a model of an equipotential gravity surface whose potential is chosen so that it most closely fits <ins>M</ins>ean <ins>S</ins>ea <ins>L</ins>evel (MSL). A fundamental property of a geoid is then that it is aligned everywhere to the local horizon plane (You will learn more about geoids in the Geodesy course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference ellipsoids are usually defined so that they most closely resemble a geoid model. Differences between MSL and geoids typically range on the order of a few meters, whereas differences between ellipsoids and their associated geoids may range up to hundreds of meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in height between a geoid and ellipsoid are known as undulations. In the case of the EGM2008 geoid there are well established undulations between it and the **WGS84** ellipsoid used by the Navstar Global Positioning System (**GPS**)\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this lab does not entail the datum shift aspects required for CRS solutions, merely reduction of the array-relative ranges to the geoid using the orthometric heights of the ship's reference frame origin, as provided by the POSMV 320\n"

Clearly we want to position ourselves relative to the Earth, which means that we need some geometrical description of it. We should not use the topography of the Earth as the model, otherwise both *Mount Everest* and the *Marianas Trench* would have an elevation of 0 m. Commonly people refer to elevations relative to sea level - however this is problematic as not the entire Earth is covered by an ocean. In reality a proxy is used to MSL, namely an equipotential gravity field that is a best fit to it. This equipotential field is known as the **Geoid** which in the figure above is represented in blue. \n",

All points in this plane on one side of the semi-minor axis are said to have the same longitude, all points on the other side are offset by $180^{\\circ}$.

The DOP number gives an indication of the strength of the geometry of the GNSS observations, but notably **not** the quality of the observations!
